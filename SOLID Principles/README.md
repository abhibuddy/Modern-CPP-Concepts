## SOLID Principles 
##### These are set of 5 principles to improve the software design

- S: [Single Responsibility Principle](#SRP)
- O: [Open-Closed Principle](#OCP)
- L: [Liskov Substitution Principle](#LSP)
- I: [Interface Segregation Principle](#ISP)
- D: [Dependency Inversion Principle](#DIP)

##SRP
##### Single Responsibility Principle : Imagine if a cook also had to serve food and wash dishes. That’s a lot of jobs! It’s better to have one cook who only cooks, one server who serves, and one dishwasher who washes. Each person (or class) focuses on one task.
##OCP
##### Open-Closed Principle Make new features by adding new stuff, not changing the old stuff.Imagine a toy box with different toys inside. If you want to add a new toy, you just put it inside without taking apart the box. You’re adding to it, not changing the box.
##LSP
##### Liskov Substitution Principle : If something is a type of another thing, it should work in the same way. Like a toy car and truck both should work like a vehicle.
##ISP
##### Interface Segregation Principle : In a video game, only have the buttons you need, like one for driving, one for flying.Don’t force people to do things they don’t need.
##DIP
##### Dependency Inversion Principle : Big things shouldn’t depend on tiny details.Imagine building a Lego car. The car shouldn’t be built around a single wheel type. If a new wheel type comes out, you should be able to swap it in without changing the whole car.
